# Cyprus Koltin User Group
KUG Cyprus is for everyone who is interested in Kotlin. Doesn't matter whether you're a beginner or an expert, more into Android or Backend - we all want to learn more about Kotlin and have some fun together! 

Here we will post meetup anouncements and content. We are in the stage of planing our first meeting, meanwhile you can connect with fellow Kotlin users in our [telegram chat](https://t.me/kug_cy).
